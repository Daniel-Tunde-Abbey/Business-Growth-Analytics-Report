Tracking business growth is essential for organizations aiming to maximize revenue, optimize operations, and enhance customer satisfaction. To facilitate data-driven decision-making, this Business Growth Analytics Dashboard was developed to provide insights into sales, profits, and key performance metrics across various dimensions such as product categories, regions, and customer segments. This interactive dashboard allows users to explore trends and identify areas of improvement, ultimately contributing to more informed business strategies.
